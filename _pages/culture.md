## Organizational Culture Models

A short overview from Springer is here [Organizational Culture Models (PDF)](https://www.google.rs/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj9pZmGmLfYAhXEWBQKHQ1yA44QFgg7MAM&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.springer.com%2Fcda%2Fcontent%2Fdocument%2Fcda_downloaddocument%2F9783319118260-c1.pdf%3FSGWID%3D0-0-45-1488863-p177004790&usg=AOvVaw2Py3ndi25fcx_SBQznpjjd). The following is a summary:

### Harrison's Culture Model

Harrison's Culture Model (1972, 1987) splits culture types into Low/High Formalization and Low/High Power Centralization.

	<colgroup>
		<col class="col-xs-2">
		<col class="col-xs-2">
		<col class="col-xs-2">
		<col class="col-xs-6">
	</colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Culture</th>
			<th>Power Structures</th>
			<th>Formality</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Power Orientation</td>
			<td>Centralized Power</td>
			<td>Low Formality</td>
			<td>Power lies within a small group of individuals, who are the primary decision makers. Common in companies based on family ownership or newer small companies.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Role Orientation</td>
			<td>Centralized Power</td>
			<td>High Formality</td>
			<td>Strong emphasis on hierarchy and status, clear defined roles, following formalized agreements, rules and procedures.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Task (Achievement) Orientation</td>
			<td>Decentralized Power</td>
			<td>High Formality</td>
			<td>Focus on achieve certain goals (includes both economic and non-economic goals), stuctures and activities are executed such that they maximally contribute to the achievement of those goals.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Person (Support) Orientation</td>
			<td>Decentralized Power</td>
			<td>Low Formality</td>
			<td>Focus on the human component. Asserting authority is discouraged; individuals exert influence through helpfulness and caring.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>



### Schneider's Culture Model

Schneider's Culture Model (1999) splits culture types on two dimensions: Personal/Impersonal and Actuality/Possibility.

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-hover">
	<colgroup>
		<col class="col-xs-2">
		<col class="col-xs-2">
		<col class="col-xs-2">
		<col class="col-xs-6">
	</colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Culture</th>
			<th>Personal / Impersonal</th>
			<th>Actuality / Possibility</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Collaboration</td>
			<td>Personal</td>
			<td>Actuality</td>
			<td>Based on the notion of family-like structures. Emphasise forming teams with positive affective relationships, where status and rank are not prominent.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Control</td>
			<td>Impersonal</td>
			<td>Actuality</td>
			<td>Focused on order, predictability, and stability, with highly impersonal decision making. Emphasise objectivity and rationality, instead of subjectivity and emotions.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Competence</td>
			<td>Impersonal</td>
			<td>Possibility</td>
			<td>Focused on the achievement motive, competing against a standard of excellence. The goal is to be the best in the market: having the best product, service, process, etc.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Cultivation</td>
			<td>Personal</td>
			<td>Possibility</td>
			<td>There is an underlying belief system, with unquestioning trust in the organization. Individuals are commited to fulfilling worthwhile purposes based on what is deemed as valuable.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>


### Cameron and Quinn's Culture Model

Cameron and Quinn's Culture Model (2011) splits culture along the competing values Flexibility (Flexibility and Discretion) / Control (Stability and Control) and Internal (Internal Focus and Integration) / External (External Focus and Differentiation) factors.

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-hover">
	<colgroup>
		<col class="col-xs-2">
		<col class="col-xs-2">
		<col class="col-xs-2">
		<col class="col-xs-6">
	</colgroup>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Culture</th>
			<th>Flexibility / Control</th>
			<th>Internal / External Focus</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Clan (Collaborate)</td>
			<td>Flexible</td>
			<td>Internal Focus</td>
			<td>Strong team-oriented approach, and key element is supporting the participation, commitment and loyalty among the employees. It is a friendly environment, where success is measured by the internal climate, level of teamowrk and concensus, and concern for the people.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Adhocracy (Create)</td>
			<td>Flexible</td>
			<td>External Focus</td>
			<td>Focused on adaptability and innovation - the workplaces are dynamic and entreprenurial. Leaders are visionary and innovative. Success is measure by being at the leading edge of new products and services.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Market (Compete)</td>
			<td>Control</td>
			<td>External Focus</td>
			<td>Assumes that the external environemnt is hostile, and that the core focus of the organization is driving towards productivity, results and profits. Success is defined by winning in the market.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Hierarchy (Control)</td>
			<td>Control</td>
			<td>Internal Focus</td>
			<td>Operate well in stable environments, very structured and formalized, whereby procedures govern what people do. The overal focus is on stability, preditability and efficiency.</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

## Performance-oriented culture models

Based on the models above, the Software Codex where the primary focus is on performance, it is aligned with the following types of cultures:

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-md-8">	
		<div class="row">		
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title">Peformance / Achievement / Success / Competition</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						(Driving / Primary Orientation)
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						Maps to "Task/Achievement Orientation" in Harrison's Culture Model, "Competence" in Schneider's Culture Model, and "Adhocracy (Create)" / "Market (Compete)" in Cameron and Quinn's Culture Model
					</div>
				</div>			
			</div>
		</div>
	
		<div class="row">		
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<div class="panel panel-default">
					<div class="panel-heading">
						<h3 class="panel-title">Control / Stability / Procedures / Formality</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						(Supporting / Secondary Orientation)
					</div>
					<div class="panel-body">
						Maps to "Role Orientation" in Harrison's Culture Model, "Control" in Schneider's Culture Model, and "Hierarchy (Control)" in Cameron and Quinn's Culture Model
					</div>
				</div>	
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	
	<div class="col-md-4">
		<img src="images/culture.svg" alt="Culture" width="100%" />
	</div>
</div>

Thus, the dynamic fluctuation here is: achieving high performance levels, exercising control via procedures to maintain those performance levels, but at the same time fostering innovation to achieve even higher performance levels, followed by again embedding it into control and procedures, and so on.

The key difference here is that it is a dynamic model, whereby it fluctuates between two cultural modes.
