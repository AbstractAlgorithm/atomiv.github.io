## Business Features

The Atomviv template provides an example of implementing functional requirements for a company which purchases products from suppliers and then sells them to customers. This was chosen because it's a very popular and well-known domain, so we used it to illustrate sample implementation. The following is an overview of the use cases implemented.

Customers:

* Creating customers
* Editing customer details
* Deactivating customers
* Browsing customers
* Viewing a customer

Orders:

* Creating draft orders
* Editing draft orders
* Submitting orders
* Cancelling orders
* Archiving orders
* Browsing orders
* Viewing an order

Products:

* Creating products
* Editing product details
* Unlisting products
* Relisting products
* Syncing products with external sources
* Browsing products
* Viewing a product

## Architecture Features

Atomiv architecture is built based on the following architecture and design approaches:

* Clean Architecture
* Domain Driven Design
* Use Case Driven Design
* Test Driven Design

Architecture template features:

* Extensibility: Ready made template provides the setup for the software architecture. Architecture includes REST API, application, domain, database connectivity (supports swapping).
* Productivity: Easy. Simple. Fast. Create controllers, services and repositories in minutes. We've dramatically reduced the amount of code you need to write to get the system up and running.
* Quality: Follow best practices in architecture, modularisation, separation of web, business and data access layers. Build high quality easily maintenable and extensible apps.
