description: Building high performance IT organizations
---

As an IT leader, have you ever asked yourself the following questions:

1. How do we get the most from our software development team, how to inspire them to perform at the highest level?
2. How do we structure the processes to ensure build high quality software (low defect rate) and high ROI (decreasing development cost)?
3. How do we not only reach these high performance levels, but how also exceed them, how do we grow to the next level?

If you've answered "yes" to all three questions, then welcome to Software Codex! This is an open source codex which is here for you, to support you in building and leading exceptional software teams and reaching levels that are beyond what you thought was possible. Unlike most other books, websites and trainings, the unique value you'll get from A+ CODEX is that it will show you how to create a synergy between leadership and technical excellence and reach high performance levels.

## A+ Culture

But how do I know if Software Codex is going to work in my organization? Well it really depends on the underlying organizational culture, organizational culture defines the underlying assumptions, values and beliefs. The key question is, to what extent is the organizational culture performance-oriented? (but also keeping in mind the possibility of cultural change). For more information, see [Organizational Culture Codex](_pages/culture.md).

## Dimensions



The foundation of Software Codex is that A+ Performance is an integration of three dimensions:

			Success starts with success-oriented people. You've most likely come across the following classification between A-players, people who perform at the highest levels, then there's B-players who are competent solid performers, then there's C-players who are mediocre performers. In hiring, this results in the trend that A's hide A's, whilst B's hire C's, see <a href="http://www.hrdusa.com/As_hire_As.html" target="_blank">A's Hire A's -- and B's Hire C's, Dr. Phillip E. Rosner, HRD USA</a>. So, who are these A-players? They are people who are highly achievement-motivated, they set high standards both for themselves and others. But at the same time, they want to go further ahead, they have a growth mindset, looking to reach the next level of excellence (A+ level).

		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			To ensure reproducability of successful results, certain factors are identified and they become crystallized in the form a process, which combines the success of individuals across teams. The process becomes an enabler, a systematization of the success - as a group standard. It takes the best from everyone, and embeds it into the organization by formalizing it through processes. This ensures that A level process are reached. But, in a performance-oriented organization, it doesn't end there, the processes and procedures further evolve based on inputs from innovation of the people (further improvement of quality, further cost reduction), enabling the process to reach the next level of maturity (A+ level) thereby further increasing the baseline performance standard.

			<h3 class="panel-title">A+ Product</h3>
		</div>
		<div class="panel-body">
			The outcome is the successful product. It has core characteristics of high quality (both external quality, as perceived by customers, but also internal quality, as perceived from technical standards perspective) and high ROI (product creates value, and it is increasingly lower cost to maintain, economies of scale), reaching thus A level standards. But, it doesn't stop here - the product continues further to evolve (whilst maintaining and further increasing quality, and further reducing incremental cost). Thus, it reaches the A+ level. Furthermore, this has impact on the people and the process - because any deficits found in the product serve as motivation to improve the mechanism how the product is made.
