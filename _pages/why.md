Why should every company have processes?


(warning: if you are running or working in a company who has no space for improvement and working with a highly self-organized team, standardized process and software solutions, feel free to skip it, you already know what to do.) 
- ovo je opciono totalno, cilj je bio da ova recenica predstavi idealan scenario i kompaniju, koja realno ne postoji, sto znaci da su procesi potrebni svima

We are living in a time where everything should be delivered super fast but with high quality. It doesn't matter if that is a service or a product, the outcome should be the same. If you miss your chance, the competition will take it, you do not need to doubt that.

<!-- (note:  add option where company or people tried this) -->

That is why, for all of us it is important to use time and be efficient as much as it is possible. Even if you are a business owner, project manager, team lead, scrum master or process manager, we all have the same goal. 

<!-- (note: add team productivity in previous paragraph) -->

We all want for our business to grow, make higher revenue, be more profitable and inspire people to be the best version of themselves. Well, let me tell you something. None of those things will happen if you don’t know why you are doing things you are doing, and if you are wasting your time on things which are irrelevant to your business.

Wanna know how to go over it? The answer is simple, start making changes with processes.

## For Project Managers 

Let’s say that you are a project manager trying to keep up with deadlines and budget but you still need to help your team because they are again struggling with the same issue as they did in the previous 2 or 3 projects. This is very frustrating for both sides.

You feel exhausted, lost, can not focus on your job and what really matters. The team is unmotivated too, because they keep trying and giving their best, but still without proper and expected results.

And then again and again, and you find yourself in the vicious cycle. 

The company is making no progress, tapping in the place, losing the team, motivation and the focus. 

Hey, no worries, these things may happen but they can be solved!

All you have to do is to find out what works the best, document it and implement step by step.
It is called process identification, improvement and implementation. 

<!--
(note: include Atomiv, how we are doing that and what we are offering)
-->

The processes which you document, establish, improve and at the end implement will give you enormous benefits and time to focus on things which really matter.

You will feel next:

1. Increase of time -  this will allow you to realize where your company or carrier is going, where do you wanna be and how to accomplish all of that
2. The team will have higher motivation - people love when they see the purpose of their work, their achievements and to feel useful. The processes will help them to avoid mistakes and work repetition, which will automatically rise productivity 
3. When productivity goes up the profitability follows -  avoiding work repetition allows the team to either do more for less time or to improve their knowledge which will bring more value in the future. Anyway, a win-win situation! 
4. Higher profitability, growth and goal accomplishment - at this point, you can focus on your goals, team goals and make sure that you are all growing together 

So, here it is, short but simple and sweet “why” and “how” processes will help you, no matter if you are running a business, managing a team, project or just wanna improve things and be better at your job.

Don’t get scared, be open minded, give your best and find your way how to do it.

This is just the beginning, we will reinforce these facts with real situations and solutions which I am sure all of us already experienced!
