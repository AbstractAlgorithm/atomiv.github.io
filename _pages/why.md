<!-- TODO: VC: I think this is now redudant because we already have the Why at the top -->
<!--
Why should every company have processes?
-->

<!-- TODO: VC: Check with TG if we will have this -->

<!--
(warning: if you are running or working in a company who has no space for improvement and working with a highly self-organized team, standardized process and software solutions, feel free to skip it, you already know what to do.) 
- ovo je opciono totalno, cilj je bio da ova recenica predstavi idealan scenario i kompaniju, koja realno ne postoji, sto znaci da su procesi potrebni svima
-->




<p>We are living in a time where everything should be delivered super fast but with high quality. It doesn't matter if that is a service or a product, the outcome should be the same. If you miss your chance, the competition will take it, you do not need to doubt that. That is why, for all of us it is important to use time and be efficient as much as it is possible. Even if you are a CEO, project manager, team lead, scrum master or process manager, we all have the same goal. We all want for our business to grow, make higher revenue, be more profitable and inspire people to be the best version of themselves. Well, let me tell you something. None of those things will happen if you don’t know why you are doing things you are doing, and if you are wasting your time on things which are irrelevant to your business.</p>

<p>Want to know how to go over it? The answer is simple, start making changes with processes. All you have to do is to find out what works the best, document it and implement step by step. It is called process identification, improvement and implementation. The processes which you document, establish, improve and at the end implement will give you enormous benefits and time to focus on things which really matter. This is where Atomiv comes in - it's designed to help you standardize software development processes across the company, spanning both organizational and technical aspects. So, here it is, short but simple and sweet “why” and “how” processes will help you, no matter if you are running a business, managing a team, project or just want to improve things and be better at your job. Reach the next level with the Atomiv.</p>

<h2>For Companies</h2>

<p>Some key challenges faced by IT service companies are keeping clients happy and ensuring good profit margins. When the software is delivered late, when it's too buggy or non-usable, when clients cannot depend on your company - then they might switch. Furthermore, when projects go over-budget, the IT service company may suffer due to the loss on uninvoiced hours or haggling over hourly invoices.  Atomiv helps your company succeed again and again across different projects, making success repeatable through standardization. Atomiv helps companies build high performance software development teams. It helps increase productivity and motivation across your development teams, helping them deliver software faster than ever before and with high quality. It helps keep your customers happy, strengthen long-term trust and customer relationships, and increases your profit margins.</p>

<h2>For Teams</h2>

<p>One of the difficulties in software development industry is attracting and retaining "talent". It's challenging enough finding the "right" developers, but what's even more challenging (and important) is building a strong team. If there isn't adequate teamwork, and if all the knowledge about a project is held by a few individuals, this causes the key-man risk in projects. If there aren't common standards held by the team, if individuals within teams are going their own way, or if different teams are adopting totally different processes and codebases, this results in inefficiencies across the company. It's then difficult to switch people between teams or onboard new team members. Atomiv helps you achieve standardization within teams and across teams, encouraging an organiation culture which strives towards standardization and continuous improvement, and helping you build top-notch teams.</p>

<!-- TODO: TG: Can write/revise this section - note: the initial content that you see below, the second half of the paragraph is from your project management description, I moved it up here -->

<h2>For CEOs</h2>

<p>As a CEO of an IT company, you are likely focused on retaining customer loyaly and trust, and ensuring your able to keep your company running profitably. You want to be ahead of your competition. You realize that the people in your company are your key assets - that without them, you're not able to succeed to deliver. But how will you manage to do this, when there might be layers between you and the development teams who are doing the actual projects, and who have direct impact on customer satisfaction? How do you ensure that your vision is implemented in day-to-day operations? By standardizing processes, it helps your company systematize success. This will decrease number of problems your dealing with and provide you with more time to focus on vision and strategy. The team will have higher motivation - people love when they see the purpose of their work, their achievements and to feel useful. The processes will help them to avoid mistakes and work repetition, which will automatically rise productivity. When productivity goes up the profitability follows -  avoiding work repetition allows the team to either do more for less time or to improve their knowledge which will bring more value in the future. Anyway, a win-win situation! Higher profitability, growth and goal accomplishment - at this point, you can focus on your goals, team goals and make sure that you are all growing together.</p>

<h2>For Project Managers</h2>

<p>Let’s say that you are a Project Manager trying to keep up with deadlines and budget but you still need to help your team because they are again struggling with the same issue as they did in the previous two or three projects. This is very frustrating for both sides. You feel exhausted, lost, can not focus on your job and what really matters. The team is unmotivated too, because they keep trying and giving their best, but still without proper and expected results. And then again and again, and you find yourself in the vicious cycle.  The company is making no progress, tapping in the place, losing the team, motivation and the focus. Hey, no worries, these things may happen but they can be solved! By adopting Atomiv, it helps provide you with a template for managing your projects, so that you can execute your projects smoothly, help your team work productively and achieve the project goals.</p>

<h2>For Software Architects</h2>

<p>As a Software Architect, you understand that architecture is essential for building high quality maintainable software solutions. One of the key factors which affect the total cost of software development is the software architecture. Are you facing challenges due to lack of architecture standardization across your company. Have you faced challenges explaining to upper management why more attention should be paid to architecture standardization, but perhaps your faced with arguments such as "we don't have time for it now", or "there's high priority client projects now". Is the topic ignored - until consequences start appearing during maintenance, including high defect rates, low developer productivity, too many meetings, inconsistent solutions... Quoting Uncle Bob (Clean Architecture), "The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system" and that the ultimate goal is "to minimize the lifetime cost of the system and to maximize programmer productivity". This is why Atomiv was built - to create software architects with a solid ready-made solution architecture to reduce the time for boilerplate architecture and help you focus on more challenging work. </p>

<h2>For Team Leads</h2>

<p>As a team lead, your faced with both organizational and technical challenges. How well your team performs is how your own performance is measured. Are you faced with challenges by trying to keep with budget and timelines, and keeping the project managers happy? On the other hand, are you faced with challenges in keeping your development team productive and ensuring technical excellence? Atomiv helps you create high performance development teams, empowering and motivating your team to perform their best. It provides your team with templates to achieve technical excellence and work more productively. It encourages a team culture which strives towards continuous improvement. The result is that your team can build software which delivers high value to customers, ensuring high quality from start to finish, reducing number of bugs, sppeding up development of new features, delivering projects on schedule and within budget. It helps you achieve success throughout your team through standardization.</p>

<h2>For Senior Developers</h2>

<p>Are you a Senior Developer looking to fine-tune your skillsets, to write software faster and with higher quality? To write clean, testable and maintainable code? Do you want to adopt best practices, but are you finding it difficult to fine the time? Do you want to be able to mentor and support junior developers and to provide them with the right foundation instead of learning from bad examples? Do you find the need for code standardization, producing internallly shared codebase and templates, but is it taking too long and there isn't time for it? Atomiv can support senior developers by providing a high quality solution templates so that senior developers can create a new project quickly, and it also makes it easier for seniors to train juniors by having a template with best practice examples that mimick real-life project needs. It also supports Senior Developers in promoting standardization within the teams.</p>

<h2>For Junior Developers</h2>

<p>As a Junior Developer, are you finding it challenging to be productive in your software project? Do you find it confusing when similar functionalities have been implemented in totally different ways, when there aren't any standards, and when everyone has their own viewpoint? Do you find it takes a long time to switch between different modules or different projects because they've all been done differently? Do you have to spend a lot of time searching on Google, looking for tutorials? Do you wish there was an all-in-one example which would help you work faster? If junior developers are provided with a poor foundation, working on a project with low quality code, then they won't know any better. This is where Atomiv can help - by providing a template for the entire project architecture and with end-to-end sample working code, developed with best practices in mind, it provides junior developers with practical quality examples so that they can follow the template and apply it for new features and functionalities. When junior developers are provided with a solid foundation in software practices and clean code examples, they will be able to contribute with high productivity to software development, and helps companies grow talent in-house.  Over time, these juniors become more experienced and they can mentor and support the next generation of developers.</p>

<h2>For QA Engineers</h2>

<p>Are you a Test Automation Engineer who wants to write automated tests faster and make them easy to maintain? Do you find that writing system tests, including REST API and Web Browser tests, is time-consuming? Are the tests brittle, causing a lot of time to maintain? Are the tests unreliable? Atomiv adopts a test-first approach, adopting Test Driven Development (TDD), Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD). The template for QA engineers provides wrappers for web clients to speed up REST API clients, and enabling QA enginers to easily make web requests and verify responses. It also providers wrappers for Selenium elements to enable QA engineers to write end-to-end tests with less code and faster than before.</p>

## For Architects



One of the key challenges in software development is the overall productivity of the development team and consequently - the total cost of ownership, i.e. cost of development and cost of maintenance. 

Q Architectural decisions are the “big” decisions which affect the structure of the software solution and which later become apparent when we analyze developer productivity, particularly during software maintenance.



As a software architect, Atomiv will help you build products with a solid architecture:

Atomiv was envisioned to help you design and implement high quality architectures for software projects and products. Atomiv provides a templated solution architecture based on well-known best practices in clean architecture.

This enables software teams to achieve the following:

* Decrease overall development and maintenance costs
* Enable high level of testability and high quality level
* Provide a standardized foundation for software development teams
