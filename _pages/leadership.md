			<td>Leaders are "born". Leaders are those that have certain mental, physical, social traits (intelligence, responsibility, creativity, height, etc.). This was inspired by the field of Psychometrics and focus on personality theories in psychology. However, there were reliability issues in the studeies, no consideration of the leadership context, lacking explanations between traits and impact on leadership. A person was either born to be a leader or not, it could not be trained.</td>
