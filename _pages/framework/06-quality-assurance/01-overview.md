Quality isn't a thing in itself, it's a byproduct of the processes (manufacuturing, engineering, any other process) whatever you do to transform inputs into outputs and how those processes interact with each other. It's how well you design, plan and execute your processes in order to achieve the intended outcomes and efficiency. Having metrics let's you monitor the processes.

When issues in quality, go back to processes, in which process something went wrong.

what are the benefits of quality and how it relates to efficiency / productivity / predictability / standardization / defect prevention or reduction / etc. (i.e. motivators for top management to invest in quality)

inspection, quality cost management (4 contributors to cost -> internal failures, e.g. making parts also reworking, anyuthing that doesn't allow product to go smoothly.... if something leaves company and goes to customer then that's external quality, their time to return and get new product, spending analysis and corrective action.... also appraisal, inspection, don;t make it to customer... also cost of prevention, spending some time designing a fixture that can't make a bad part... when balance this with cost to inspect then overall win in the long term) -> quality related to overall benefits.
