## Overview

Recruitment - in the context of collaborative technology projects - denotes a broad set of business processes and human activities that enable cross-functional teams to optimize their collective efficacy by adding complimentary skillsets, hard and soft.

Each set of recruiting activities is heavily dependent upon the specific organisational needs, and will differ substantially from case to case. However, there are a set of core ingredients that form the kernel of a typical recruitment process.

What we'll do in this article is adopt the fictional use case of a Berlin-based startup building Observability software, in order to examine the common threads of a well-designed recruitment lifecycle, and talk about the different considerations involved at each stage.

## Define

The primary recruiter and the key stakeholders must get together to define the organisational needs, and layout a recruitment roadmap for a given time period. In many cases, this may mean looking forward across the coming 12 month period, and then breaking that down further in terms of prioritisation.

From the outcome of this process, we might decide that the ideal hiring roadmap should look something like this:
* Q1 ー 1 Senior Backend Enginer
* Q2 ー 2 Mid-level Backend Engineers
* Q3 ー 1 Senior Frontend Engineer + 1 Junior Frontend Engineer
* Q4 ー UX Specialist + Devops Engineer + Customer Support Engineer

Once we have this high-level overview, and have reconciled it with the annual hiring budget, we are now in a position to operate at item level.

1. Define the ideal profile, in terms of the following:
  - Hard skills (what they bring to the table on day 1)
    - golang and/or c++
    - distributed systems
    - has worked on projects from ideation to production
    - 5-7 years of post-graduation experience
  - Soft skills (what personal characteristics will be important in being successful)
    - potential for leading a team
    - interested in mentoring + development
    - enjoys CS theory
  - Motivation (why they want to make this change)
    - not impressed by current state of market
    - disillusioned by small contribution in big company
    - interested by specific technical challenge
  - Interview Process
    - Who is going to be involved
    - How will it be structured
    - What review mechanisms do we need
   
## Anticipate

There are going to be some recurring resources that we need throughout the recruiting process. Because this is a hybrid exercise, most of these resources will fall under the category of marketing materials. So we make an index of the available resources at our disposal:

* Website
* Collateral documents (explaining product) or demo videos
* Relevant team bios
* Company blog
* Links to press, publicity or announcements
* A simple app outlining key info
* Any other online/offline resources that add value

Build a list of important background factors, which may include such things as:
  - Ideal target companies
  - Companies to avoid (clients, partners, investor network etc)
  - Relevant companies that are experiencing layoffs
  - Former colleagues from group network

Devise a search strategy:
  - Where are we going to find these individuals (e.g. Linkedin, Job Board, Referral, Employee Network etc)
  - Who is going to be in charge of the deliverables (e.g. Recruiter, Recruitment Project Manager, Founding team etc)
  - Review process (e.g. Friday status update meeting)

## Identify

In the talent landscape of 2020, the process of identification is indelibly entwined with the technical act of boolean querying. 

Boolean queries are a means of interrogating datasets so as to obtain results that suit your needs. For more information:

Our biggest talent dataset for software engineers is currently LinkedIn, so we will use this platform as our primary locus of talent identification. It should be noted that other platforms (Github, StackOverflow, Job Boards, Meetup, Event Databases, University Lists etc) could be used along similar lines, with different specifics. Every online database that is publicly/privately accessible, can be queried for relevant results.

Example Search String: (”software engineer” OR “senior engineer” OR “senior software”) AND (observability OR metrics OR traces OR logs OR tracing OR logging) AND (c++ OR golang)

This is starter search-string, intended to give us enough information to conduct the next segment of our search. By trawling the results from the starter-search, we equip ourselves with a library of keywords, market data and pattern data which enables us to continually iterate on our query content.

## Engage

How do we establish contact with them? What are the different options? How much are we prepared to invest in each outgoing communication? What are we expecting in terms of success metrics? Do we adopt a volume-based approach, or a quality based approach? Do we know who is going to be responsible for this vast body of work?

We need to make sure that the message is carefully scripted, trying to optimize for the following components:
* tone
* credibility
* context
* personalization
* clarity

We might come up with the following intro message:

Name,

I’ve read all about your work @ insert_company_name doing insert_personalized_content.

We are a Berlin based engineering team focused on setting the direction of Observability for the next 10-20 years. After working in Google’s Distributed Tracing team for a combined 30+ years, we realized that it’s possible and preferable to combine Metrics, Traces & Logs under one single intuitive UI. Check out our backgrounds here and here, or check out our demo here.

After securing $3M in Series A funding from our preferred investors, we’re looking to scale the Backend engineering team with further energy, knowledge and enthusiasm. From what we’ve read about your background, you would be a perfect fit. Please take a look at the formal requirements here.

Would you be open to jumping on a call to discuss in more detail?

Best regards,
Recruiter 

The messaging must be continually improved, updated, critiqued, and optimized (A/B testing, hiring manager feedback, cross-team collaboration etc). 

Eventually, we will end up with a scenario where we have interested candidates ready to interview.

## Screen

Now we have candidates in play, we need to separate the wheat from the chaff. So we will implement a screening process which optimizes on all elements of organisational requirement:

- Motivation Screening → basic assessment: why do you want to join us, what similar work have you done in the past, what questions do you have about our team/org
- Light technical Screening → verbal assessment: tell us about the technical detail of similar work you have done in the past, what are your thoughts about the current state of Observability
- Written Technical Assessment → either customized/improvised, or using an established online assessor (e.g. HackerRank, Codesignal. Codility etc)
- Final Screening → what reservations do you have about our mission? what will you focus on in week 1 if we don’t dictate terms? what do you think of our competitors?

## On-board

Now that we’ve done all this work, let’s make sure it sticks. Questions that need to be asked:
- how was week 1?
- how’s your relationship with your manager?
- what does the rest of your team look like?
- are you working on things that you discussed beforehand?
- how is the day-to-day culture?
- what changes would you make if you were in charge?
- what are you expected to accomplish by the end of the month?
- what are you expected to accomplish by the end of the quarter?
- what are you expected to accomplish by the end of the year?
- do you think that is achievable?
