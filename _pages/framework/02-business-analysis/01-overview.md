## What is business analysis in IT

Business analysis is a broad profession. According to Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK® v3) published by International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA), "Business analysis is the practice of enabling change in an enterprise by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders. Business analysis enables an enterprise to articulate needs and the rationale for change, and to design and describe solutions that can deliver value." 
Business analysis can be performed from a diverse array of perspectives, and Information Technology is one of them. When working in the information technology (IT) discipline, business analysts collaborate with both the business stakeholders and technical teams to ensure that needs are understood, and that designed solution meets business objectives and brings real value.
 
## What is the role of business analysis in IT solution
 
Business analysis role include:
* Learn and understand - dig deep into problem domain to understand its logic, terminology, regulations, rules, players
* Analyze - translate unstructured narratives into concepts, abstractions, relations, patterns, models
* Provide Insight - organize, present and deliver complex interrelated heterogeneous information in meaningful way (decompose, slice/layer, visualize)
* Design - create functional design(s) of future solution (how will or could it be when it is solved)
* Consult - explain what is good and what is bad, what is viable, what it takes, what is risky, what are possible routes
 
## What is the importance of business analysis

Business analysis help technical teams to understand specifics of business domain, so they can design and build IT solution that will be accepted by business stakeholders. When properly informed on business domain concepts and relations, technical teams make better design decisions and anticipate and handle risks proactively.

On the other hand, business analysis helps business stakeholders to understand characteristics of the intended solution before it is built, so they can provide feedback in early phases and guide technical teams.

Business analysis importance may be summarized in several points:
* Reduce rework (do the right thing first time)
* Better work prioritization (each feature may be assessed by value it brings)
* Proactive risks management (business analysis provides holistic view to the problem being solved and helps stakeholders to anticipate future state)
* May help in reducing amount of work to be done (by recognizing patterns and similar concepts, helps in creating generic and reusable artefacts)
