I"Õ<p>Code duplication is a serious issue in software development, because it is one of the primary causes of high maintenance cost and reduction in quality. In cases of code duplication, it increases the code base size, thereby increasing the cost of any subsequent changes or bug fixes, causing development and test efforts to be unnecessarily duplicated. From a technical perspective, code duplication is a big problem because it violates some of the core underlying principles - it violates the DRY Principle and the Abstraction Principle. In this article, we review the concepts underlying code duplication, the costs of code duplication, different types of code duplication and how code duplication may be refactored.</p>
