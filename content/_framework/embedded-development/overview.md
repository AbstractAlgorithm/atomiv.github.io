## What is Embedded Systems

Embedded systems can be thought of as encapsulated or autonomous systems that are developed for handle certain tasks. They contain a processor or microcontroller that are executing the code. The processor can read the data from its sensors, i.e. thermometer and perform an action such as turn the fridge on if the temperature has increased beyond a treshold. 
Embedded Development is about developing software that is executed on an embedded processor.
According to Encyclopedia Brittanica “Embedded processor, a class of computer, or computer chip, embedded in various machines”. When developing a product that uses a microcontroller there has to be certain use cases are meant which is different that a PC which is general device i.e. is not targeting special use cases. A special use case can be measuring temperature in the room or measuring the heart rate and if necessary triggers the heart, all according to added parameters by the programmer. 
Embedded processors often use a battery as an energy source. Therefore it is necessary to keep in mind not to consume unnecessary energy when that is not needed. Such situation can be to reduce the speed that the processor is executing the software. However the developer needs to develop the software . Another solution can be to put the microcontroller in a sleep mode. In that case it needs to be woken up, which is also the task of the developer to know what can be important in order to wake up the microcontroller.
 the product to take situations into account. The software developed is targeting special use cases. 
 
 Some procudts that belong to the category of embedded systems:
 * Pacemaker
 * Smartphone
 * Missile

The final product should not have an overhead... 
Additional memory is a good thing though ...
Bootloader ...
Memory laoyout ...
