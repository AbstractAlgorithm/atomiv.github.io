## This is a heading

Change management is often directed towards solving performance problems, including internal organizational aspects such as efficiency and profitability,  or responding to changing market opportunities. Change management efforts are hence usually directed at changing or enhancing organizational assets, capabilities and resources. Hence, we often see companies engage in highly structured initiatives such as Six Sigma, TQM and process re-engineering. Change management is also seen in a different perspective when leadership is involved.  On the other hand, the leadership perspective on change management goes to a level higher than the organizational processes and assign a more prominent role to organizational leadership as the main sponsor and initiator of change. The most renowned leadership framework of change management is Kotterâ€™s eight steps of change management which include: establish a sense of urgency; create a guiding coalition; develop a vision and strategy; communicate the change vision; empower broad-based action; generate short-term wins; consolidate gains and produce more change; and anchor new approaches in the corporate culture. Significantly, Kotter,  when highlighting the need to establish a sense of urgency of change as the first step in his model, prompts organisations to not only focus on the internal change processes but also to evaluate the external environment which includes the competitive landscape, market trends, and the state of technology.
