## Introduction

Leadership…
…Is about both principles (section 1 below) and practices (section 2 below)
… Applies to anyone in any role no matter how many people in the team
… Is tightly linked with effective management
… Needs to be adapted to situation and context
The below principles are not “MECE”, but are the key things to emphasise over and above “generally accepted” leadership principles

### Connect the dots to a higher mission

* Usually there but not visible to others

* Refocus if necessary

### Be a shock absorber

* Where possible, don't pass blame downhill
* Where appropriate, don't push blame uphill
* Where practical, pluck thorns and plant roses

### Focus on what’s possible

* Internally within the team
