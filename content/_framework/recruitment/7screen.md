### Screen

Now we have candidates in play, we need to assess them according to the criteria that we outlined earlier (hard skills, soft skills, motivation). We will carry out an interview process which optimizes on all elements of our organisational requirements. At a framework level, it might look something like this:

- **Stage 1 --> Motivation Screening** 
   - basic assessment, addressing overall suitability and important contextual information. The agenda might look like this:
      - candidate introduces background and experience
      - recruiter introduces company and team
      - bilateral Q&A

- **Stage 2 --> Light Technical Screening**
   - verbal assessment of technical credentials, conducted by hiring manager or somebody else with technical know how. The agenda might look like this: 
      - candidate talks about past project history
      - interviewer asks for specific details around project requirements, team structure, technical decisions, problems encountered etc
      - direction of interview is driven by the interplay between both parties

- **Stage 3 --> Written Technical Assessment**
   - written assessment of technical credentials: either improvised, or using an established online assessor (e.g. HackerRank, Codesignal, Codility etc)
      - should not be so time intensive that it puts off potential candidates

- **Stage 4 --> Final Screening** 
   - holistic conversation focused on future contribution and addressing information assymetry. The agenda might look like this:
      - interviewer gets feedback on interview process so far
      - interviewer talks about a typical working day at the company
      - interviewer talks about specific challenges that might be encountered 
      - candidate asks questions
      
- **Stage 5 --> Offer Preparation + Release**
   - employment details are finalized, compensation levels agreed, contracts are exchanged and signed
