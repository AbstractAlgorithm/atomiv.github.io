## Overview

Recruitment denotes a broad set of business processes and human activities that enable cross-functional teams to optimize their collective efficacy by adding complimentary skillsets, hard and soft. Done well, recruiting can be an incredible business enabler which allows a team to add the right specialist knowledge, at the right time, with maximal impact across the whole organisation. Done badly, recruiting can be a drain on time and resources, with long-term damage that can be hard to undo.

Each set of recruiting activities is heavily dependent upon the specific organisational needs, and will differ substantially from case to case. A five-person startup has very different requirements to a publicly listed multinational. However, there are a set of core ingredients that form the kernel of a well-designed recruitment process, and these can be adapted as required. 

This underlying framework can further be understood as outlining a series of optimization problems. By understanding the optimization dynamics at every point of the process, a management team should be able to implement a recruitment process that is perfectly suited to their own business needs, balancing the interplay of budget, timelines and human input to push towards best case scenarios which cater for growth and resilience.

It should also be noted that many of the activites outlined in this framework constitute generalist tasks which may serve as a useful indicators of overall business health and agility. If any of the steps outlined prove difficult to follow, that may be an indication of business immaturity, siloed information hierarchies, insufficient intra-team communication, overly centralised decision making, or similar.
