## Overview

Recruitment denotes a broad set of business processes and human activities that enable cross-functional teams to optimize their collective efficacy by adding complimentary skillsets, hard and soft. Done well, recruiting can be an incredible business enabler which allows a team to add the right specialist knowledge, at the right time, with maximal impact across the whole organisation. Done badly, recruiting can be a drain on time and resources, with long-term damage that can be hard to undo.

Each set of recruiting activities is heavily dependent upon the specific organisational needs, and will differ substantially from case to case. A five-person startup has very different requirements to a publicly listed multinational. However, there are a set of core ingredients that form the kernel of a well-designed recruitment process, and these can be adapted as required. 

This underlying framework can further be understood as outlining a series of optimization problems. By understanding the optimization dynamics at every point of the process, a management team should be able to implement a recruitment process that is perfectly suited to their own business needs, balancing the interplay of budget, timelines and human input to push towards best case scenarios which cater for growth and resilience.

It should also be noted that many of the activites outlined in this framework constitute generalist tasks which may serve as a useful indicators of overall business health and agility. If any of the steps outlined prove difficult to follow, that may be an indication of business immaturity, siloed information hierarchies, insufficient intra-team communication, overly centralised decision making, or similar.

## Roles

<!-- List of roles: Recruiter, Recruitment Project Manager, Founding team .... roles and responsibilities (what the role is and what are the responsibilities covered by role) -->

Any recruitment process is going to start with an acknowledgement that the existing team needs to be supplemented with additional expertise. Whether that realisation comes from management, team members, investors, or from elsewhere, it necessitates the creation of an adhoc or a formalized team structure that will collaborate on a successful project planning and execution. A lean version of this assemblage might look as follows:

* **Hiring Manager** --> responsible for: identifying current capability gaps, building business case for new hire, defining hard/soft skills of new hire, securing budget approval, agreeing on structure of interview process, manging adhoc contributors, taking the lead on final decisions.

* **Recruiter** --> responsible for: working with hiring manager to document capability gaps, putting together a project plan, ensuring that all stakeholders are working together, advocating for a positive candidate experience, balancing competing priorities, delivering project to completion.

* **Recruitment Project/Programme Manager** --> responsible for: budget approval, monitoring patterns in hiring activity, supporting group wide hiring, identifying recurring blockages, establishing feedback mechanisms, implementing periodic reviews, advocating for continuous improvement and standardisation of processes.

* **Adhoc Contributors** --> responsible for: assisting with specific items of project planning and execution, delivering specialised input within the interview process, participating as contributors in evaluation meetings, advocating for needs of existing team.


<!-- Sometimes there's mutliple people taking on roles, or in smaller companies one person takes on these roles... Also someone might not have a formal designation, e.g. for a smaller company the founder or software developers could be recruiters -->


## Process

### Define

<!-- TODO: to define the organisational needs - EXPAND, for top management audience -->
<!-- TODO: recruitment roadmap - EXPAND, for top management audience... what's in a roadmpa, maybe some examples -->

Once the project team has been established, it is important that they get together to outline the key objectives and discuss the optimization challenges that they are facing.

Some of the key questions to address:
* What is the budget
* What are the time constraints
* What is the level of flexibility when it comes to budget and time
* How does this hire fit within the broader context of a long-term hiring roadmap
* Is the role definition understood across the team
* Where is this information going to be stored, and is their need for permissioned access
* How frequently does the team need to meet to review progress
* What does success look like

These are primarily "big picture" questions which frame the recruitment needs against the broader backdrop of organisation structure and strategy. Once those relationships have been understood, it is time to turn to the specific requirements. 

**Define the ideal profile**, in terms of the following:

* Hard skills (what the new hire will bring to the table on day 1)
     * Essential + Desired
* Soft skills (what personal characteristics will be important in being successful)
     * Essential + Desired
* Motivation (why this person want to make this change)

See the [template](https://atomiv.org/templates/recruitment/profile) for defining an ideal profile. Some of the factors that affect these definitions include: building for short term v building for long term, value driven business v outcomes driven business, desire to retain existing culture v desire to transform existing culture, immediate impact required v gradual ramping up.

<!-- Ideal vs good enough, how do you know when to stop looking (maybe in another section), indicators which one is suitable in which cases -->
     
**Define the interview process**, in terms of the following:
 * Who is going to be involved
 * How will it be structured
 * What is the rationale for each stage
 * What are the ideal outcomes for each stage
 * What are the feedback mechanisms that will guide the process

The major optimization challenge here is to build an interview process that is sufficiently rigorous that it eliminates all unsuitable candidates, without placing unnecessary procedural barriers that discourage capable applicants from completing the interview process. A seven stage process will usually generate more useful insights about candidate suitability than a three stage process, but, the length of the process itself may become an obstacle. When thinking about this dynamic, the recruitment team should aim to remove as much friction as possible, without compromising unduly on screening rigor. An interview process that is simultaneously enjoyable and challenging is a standard feature of hiring at companies who have been successful in navigating this optimization challenge.


**Define the search strategy**, in terms of the following:
  
 * Passive Strategy
    * Posting adverts and generating candidate flow via responses 
    * These adverts may be places on resources like LinkedIn, Job Boards, Industry Networking websites, and so on
    * The cost is best calculated in terms of total advertising cost, and time invested in screening incoming resumes
 * Active Strategy
    * Identifying candidates via boolean querying of web resources
    * These queries can be run against datasets contained on LinkedIn, Job Boards, GitHub, Internal Databases, and so on
    * The cost is best calculated in terms of subscription cost, and time invested in active outreach
 * Hybrid Strategy
    * Elements of both of the above

   
### Anticipate

Once the high-level and low-level definition has been finalised, it is tempting to jump straight into the project execution phase. However, and this is especially true in organisations that are lacking in maturity, or operating at a high-velocity, it is vital to build an index of resources that will be required throughout the interview process.

This comes down to the fact that recruitment is a two-way exercise. On the one hand, it is important to define and screen so that the right candidates are identified and assessed. On the other hand, candidates must be provided with a set of informational resources which will allow them to understand the nature of the organisation that they are contemplating joining. An additional reason for encouraging this phase is that it enables to recruiting team to synchronize on messaging, presentation and language.


<!-- Before starting interviews, you'll know who the company is, what they do, how they differentiate themselves, what the culture looks like.... give people resources instead of addressing it directly.... you start to look at org as outsider, where would someone find info... neeed to make sure everyone on the team (recruiters / intervewsi) knows where they are and can link to them... Mostly useful for recruiters but also a marketing exercise. Better attract talent.... Linking to optimization - knhowledge is centralized accessbile, avoiding re-explaining same topics... and also consistent messaging between recruitment and hiring and founders, everyone on panel similar language... this is like project management -->

Make a list of the resources available to candidates looking to learn more about the business. This may include:

* Website
* Collateral documents 
* Demo videos or other product explainers
* Relevant team bios
* Company blog
* Links to press, publicity or announcements
* Past employee feedback from places like Glassdoor
* Funding announcements from places like Crunchbase
* Customer testimonials or case studies
* A simple app outlining key info
* Any other online/offline resources that add value



<!-- Clarification: These are factors regarding which employees to target vs avoid, based on the companies they work in... demands and restrictions and availabilities -->

Another valuable set of materials to collate pertains to resources that will help the recruiter in any active outbound campaigns that he/she chooses to embark upon. This may include:

* Ideal target companies (e.g. competitors, companies of a similar size/stage, companies with a similar hiring bar)
* Companies to avoid (e.g. clients, partners, investor network affiliations, companies with a low hiring bar etc)
* Relevant companies that are experiencing layoffs
* Former colleagues from team network (to target referrals)
* Past messaging used in previous hiring activities


### Identify

Assuming that there is some element of active sourcing required as part of the recruitment strategy, there will likely be need for the Recruiter to construct a set of boolean queries that surface prospective candidates with relevant skills and backgrounds. Boolean queries are a syntactically governed method of interrogating datasets so as to obtain relevant results.

One of the largest professional services datasets is curated by LinkedIn, and as such, this is a common locus for many active identification campaigns. However, every online database that is publicly/privately accessible, can be queried for relevant results. Github, StackOverflow, Job Boards, Meetup, Event Databases, University Lists (and so on) can be used along similar lines.

First order of business is to review the boolean guidelines on your platform of choice. In the case of LinkedIn, these read as follows:

> * **Quoted searches**: For an exact phrase, enclose the phrase in quotation marks. For example, type "product manager". You can also use quotation marks if you want to find someone with a multi-word title.
>    * LinkedIn search only supports standard, straight quotation marks ("). Other software or websites may use special symbols that our system does not recognize. Curly quotation marks (“), also known as smart quotes or typographer's quotes, aren't supported.
>    * In order to optimize overall site performance, stop words such as "by", "in", "with", etc. aren't used.
> * **NOT searches**: Type the word NOT (capital letters) immediately before a search term to exclude it from your search results. This typically limits your search results. For example, "programmer NOT manager".
> * **OR searches**: Type the word OR (capital letters) to see results that include one or more items in a list. This typically broadens your search results. For example, > "sales OR marketing OR advertising”.
> * **AND searches**: AND searches: Type the word AND (capital letters) to see results that include all items in a list. This typically limits your search results. For example, "accountant AND finance AND CPA".

> Note: You don't need to use AND. If your search has two or more terms, you'll automatically see results that include all of them.
> Parenthetical searches - To do a complex search, you can combine terms using parentheses. For example, to find people who have "VP" in their profiles, but exclude > "assistant to VP" or SVPs, type VP NOT (assistant OR SVP).
> When handling searches, the overall order to precedence is:

> * Quotes [""]
> * Parentheses [()]
> * NOT
> * AND
> * OR
> * Important:

> * The + and - operators are not officially supported by LinkedIn. Using AND in place of + and NOT in place of - makes a query much easier to read and guarantees that we'll handle the search correctly.
> * When using NOT, AND, or OR operators, you must type them in uppercase letters.
> * We don't support wildcard "*" searches.
> * Boolean search will work in the keyword field in Recruiter and Linkedin.com, and will work in the Company, title, and keyword field in Sales Navigator.

Now that we have been briefed on the way in which queries are parsed, we can start to formulate our own starter query, using the information put together in the definition phase earlier. 

   - **Example Search Query #1:** (”software engineer” OR “senior engineer” OR “senior software”) AND (observability OR metrics OR traces OR logs OR tracing OR logging) AND (c++ OR golang)

This is starter search-string, intended to give us enough information to conduct the next segment of our search. By trawling the results from the starter-search, we equip ourselves with a library of keywords, market data and pattern data which enables us to continually iterate on our query formulation. Each current stage of the search powers the subsequent stage, from an information perspective. So our next two searches may look like this:

   - **Example Search Query #2:** (”software engineer” OR “senior engineer” OR “senior software”) AND (observability) AND (metrics OR traces OR logs OR tracing OR logging) AND (c++ OR golang) NOT (director OR principal OR chief OR freelance OR freelancer OR contractor)

   - **Example Search Query #3:** (”software engineer” OR “senior engineer” OR “senior software”) AND (observability) AND (metrics OR traces OR logs OR tracing OR logging OR monitoring OR aggregation) AND (c++ OR golang) NOT (director OR principal OR chief OR freelance OR freelancer OR contractor OR "devops engineer" OR recruiter OR "engineering manager")

This process can be repeated ad infinitum. Typically, **OR clauses** will increase the number of results returned, whereas **AND/NOT** clauses will reduce the number of results returned. By consciously controlling this interplay between the widening and narrowing of results, we can maximize our chances of identifying the right people with the right skills in the right places.



<!-- Start off with a query, learn from the results, and then iteratively refine the query -->



### Engage



<!-- How does a recruiter establish contact with potential candidates? -->



How do we establish contact with them? What are the different options? How much are we prepared to invest in each outgoing communication? What are we expecting in terms of success metrics? Do we adopt a volume-based approach, or a quality based approach? Do we know who is going to be responsible for this vast body of work?

We need to make sure that the messaging is carefully scripted, trying to optimize for the following components:
* tone
* credibility
* context
* personalization
* clarity

We might come up with the following intro message:

*Name,*

*I’ve read all about your work @ insert_company_name doing insert_personalized_content.*

*We are a Berlin based engineering team focused on setting the direction of Observability for the next 10-20 years. After working in Google’s Distributed Tracing team for a combined 30+ years, we realized that it’s possible and preferable to combine Metrics, Traces & Logs under one single intuitive UI. Check out our backgrounds here and here, or check out our demo here.*

*After securing $3M in Series A funding from our preferred investors, we’re looking to scale the Backend engineering team with further energy, knowledge and enthusiasm. From what we’ve read about your background, you would be a perfect fit. Please take a look at the formal requirements here.*

*Would you be open to jumping on a call to discuss in more detail?*

*Best regards,*
*Recruiter* 


<!-- TODO: VC: Move over to templates section, the template will be referenced  -->


The messaging must be continually improved, updated, critiqued, and optimized (A/B testing, hiring manager feedback, cross-team collaboration etc). 

Eventually, we will end up with a scenario where we have interested candidates ready to interview.

### Screen

Now we have candidates in play, we need to assess them according to the criteria that we outlined earlier (hard skills, soft skills, motivation). We will carry out an interview process which optimizes on all elements of our organisational requirements. At a framework level, it might look something like this:

- **Stage 1 --> Motivation Screening** 
   - basic assessment, addressing overall suitability and important contextual information. The agenda might look like this:
      - candidate introduces background and experience
      - recruiter introduces company and team
      - bilateral Q&A

- **Stage 2 --> Light Technical Screening**
   - verbal assessment of technical credentials, conducted by hiring manager or somebody else with technical know how. The agenda might look like this: 
      - candidate talks about past project history
      - interviewer asks for specific details around project requirements, team structure, technical decisions, problems encountered etc
      - direction of interview is driven by the interplay between both parties

- **Stage 3 --> Written Technical Assessment**
   - written assessment of technical credentials: either improvised, or using an established online assessor (e.g. HackerRank, Codesignal, Codility etc)
      - should not be so time intensive that it puts off potential candidates

- **Stage 4 --> Final Screening** 
   - holistic conversation focused on future contribution and addressing information assymetry. The agenda might look like this:
      - interviewer gets feedback on interview process so far
      - interviewer talks about a typical working day at the company
      - interviewer talks about specific challenges that might be encountered 
      - candidate asks questions
      
- **Stage 5 --> Offer Preparation + Release**
   - employment details are finalized, compensation levels agreed, contracts are exchanged and signed

### On-board

Now that all of this work has been done, it's essential that a thorough on-boarding process is carried out to ensure that the transition passes as smoothly as possible. Some of the key questions that need to be addressed:
   - How was Week 1?
   - How was Month 1?
   - How is the relationship between new hire and manager?
   - What does the rest of the team look like?
   - Is the new hire working on things discussed beforehand?
   - How does the new hire enjoy the day-to-day working culture?
   - What changes would the new hire make if in charge?
   - What is the new hire expected to accomplish by the end of the quarter?
   - What is the new hire expected to accomplish by the end of the year?
   - Does the new hire think that this is achievable?

## Conclusions

* Recruitment is an **optimization challenge** where competing priorities seek expression in formal business schema. These competing priorities can often be characterized in terms of:
   - short-term v long-term
   - static v evolving
   - top-down v bottom-up
   - budget
   - market conditions
   - need to screen v need to sell
   
* There is **no singular best solution** to this optimization challenge.
   - all you can do is find the best model for your given organisational needs
   - it will require thinking about the organisation across multiple dimensions: marketing, sales, engineering, biz ops, public relations etc
   
* Recruiting is a team game, and requires great planning, communication, collaboration and agility
   - everyone in the business can be a recruiter
   - a healthy recruiting function is a good indicator of a healthy business
