## Conclusions

* Recruitment is an **optimization challenge** where competing priorities seek expression in formal business schema. These competing priorities can often be characterized in terms of:
   - short-term v long-term
   - static v evolving
   - top-down v bottom-up
   - large budget v small budget
   - candidate-driven market v employer-driven market
   - culture-driven company v outcomes-driven company
   
* There is **no singular best solution** to this optimization challenge.
   - all that can be done is to find the best model for the needs of a specific organisation
   - it will require thinking about the organisation across multiple dimensions: marketing, sales, engineering, biz ops, public relations etc
   
* Recruiting is a team game, and requires great planning, communication, collaboration and agility
   - everyone in the business can be a recruiter
   - a healthy recruiting function is a good indicator of a healthy business
   
* Recruitment involves people, who can be unpredictable
   - plan for the unexpected, but pay attention to patterns
