## Conclusions

* Recruitment is an **optimization challenge** where competing priorities seek expression in formal business schema. These competing priorities can often be characterized in terms of:
   - short-term v long-term
   - static v evolving
   - top-down v bottom-up
   - budget
   - market conditions
   - need to screen v need to sell
   
* There is **no singular best solution** to this optimization challenge.
   - all you can do is find the best model for your given organisational needs
   - it will require thinking about the organisation across multiple dimensions: marketing, sales, engineering, biz ops, public relations etc
   
* Recruiting is a team game, and requires great planning, communication, collaboration and agility
   - everyone in the business can be a recruiter
   - a healthy recruiting function is a good indicator of a healthy business
