## Recruitment Marketing

Once the high-level and low-level definition have been finalised, it is tempting to jump straight into the project execution phase. However, and this is especially true in organisations that are lacking in maturity, or operating at a high-velocity, it is vital to build an index of resources that will be required throughout the interview process.

This comes down to the fact that recruitment is a two-way exercise. On the one hand, it is important to define and screen so that the right candidates are identified and assessed. On the other hand, candidates must be provided with a set of informational resources which will allow them to understand the nature of the organisation that they are contemplating joining. An additional reason for encouraging this phase is that it enables the recruiting team to synchronize on messaging, presentation and language.


<!-- Before starting interviews, you'll know who the company is, what they do, how they differentiate themselves, what the culture looks like.... give people resources instead of addressing it directly.... you start to look at org as outsider, where would someone find info... neeed to make sure everyone on the team (recruiters / intervewsi) knows where they are and can link to them... Mostly useful for recruiters but also a marketing exercise. Better attract talent.... Linking to optimization - knhowledge is centralized accessbile, avoiding re-explaining same topics... and also consistent messaging between recruitment and hiring and founders, everyone on panel similar language... this is like project management -->

Make a list of the resources available to candidates looking to learn more about the business. This may include:

* Website
* Collateral documents 
* Demo videos or other product explainers
* Relevant team bios
* Company blog
* Links to press, publicity or announcements
* Past employee feedback from places like Glassdoor
* Funding announcements from places like Crunchbase
* Customer testimonials or case studies
* A simple app outlining key info
* Any other online/offline resources that add value

## Market Intelligence

<!-- Clarification: These are factors regarding which employees to target vs avoid, based on the companies they work in... demands and restrictions and availabilities -->

Another valuable set of materials to collate pertains to resources that will help the recruiter in any active outbound campaigns that he/she chooses to embark upon. This may include:

* Ideal target companies (e.g. competitors, companies of a similar size/stage, companies with a similar hiring bar)
* Companies to avoid (e.g. clients, partners, investor network affiliations, companies with a low hiring bar etc)
* Relevant companies that are experiencing layoffs
* Former colleagues from team network (to target referrals)
* Past messaging used in previous hiring activities
