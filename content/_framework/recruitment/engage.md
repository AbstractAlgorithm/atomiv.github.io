## Introduction

<!-- How does a recruiter establish contact with potential candidates? -->

Once a list of suitable candidates has been generated, it is time to start making contact with these targets. In order to do so, it will be essential to get hold of their contact details. This can be done via a number of channels, ranging from sending connection requests on LinkedIn, to utilising email generation software, to running X-Ray searches on Google.

Assuming that this has been done, the next step is to build a messaging cadence that optimizes across the following components:
* personalization
* tone
* credibility
* context
* clarity

## Sample

Thinking about these core ingredients, the following intro message might emerge as a v1:

> *Name,*

> *I’ve read all about your work @ insert_company_name doing insert_personalized_content.*

> *We are a Berlin based engineering team focused on setting the direction of Observability for the next 10-20 years. After working in Google’s Distributed Tracing team for a combined 30+ years, we realized that it’s possible and preferable to combine Metrics, Traces & Logs under one single intuitive UI. Check out our backgrounds here and here, or check out our demo here.*

> *After securing $3M in Series A funding from our preferred investors, we’re looking to scale the Backend engineering team with further energy, knowledge and enthusiasm. From what we’ve read about your background, you would be a perfect fit. Please take a look at the formal requirements here.*

> *Would you be open to jumping on a call to discuss in more detail?*

> *Best regards,*
> *Recruiter* 

This messaging should be carefully constructed to maximize the chance of positive responses, and it must be continually improved, updated, critiqued, and optimized (A/B testing, hiring manager feedback, cross-team collaboration etc). A small improvement in the quality of the messaging can yield meaningful increases in response rates and candidate flow.
