## Roles

<!-- List of roles: Recruiter, Recruitment Project Manager, Founding team .... roles and responsibilities (what the role is and what are the responsibilities covered by role) -->

Any recruitment process is going to start with an acknowledgement that the existing team needs to be supplemented with additional expertise. Whether that realisation comes from management, team members, investors, or from elsewhere, it necessitates the creation of an adhoc or a formalized team structure that will collaborate on a successful project planning and execution. 

A lean version of this assemblage might look as follows:

* **Hiring Manager** --> responsible for: identifying current capability gaps, building business case for new hire, securing budget approval, defining hard/soft skills of new hire, agreeing on structure of interview process, managing adhoc contributors, taking the lead on final decisions.

* **Recruiter** --> responsible for: working with hiring manager to document capability gaps, putting together a project plan, ensuring that all stakeholders are working together, advocating for a positive candidate experience, balancing competing priorities, delivering project to completion.

* **Recruitment Project/Programme Manager** --> responsible for: budget approval, monitoring patterns in hiring activity, supporting group wide hiring, identifying recurring blockages, establishing feedback mechanisms, implementing periodic reviews, advocating for continuous improvement and standardisation of processes.

* **Adhoc Contributors** --> responsible for: assisting with specific items of project planning and execution, delivering specialised input within the interview process, participating as contributors in evaluation meetings, advocating for needs of existing team.


<!-- Sometimes there's mutliple people taking on roles, or in smaller companies one person takes on these roles... Also someone might not have a formal designation, e.g. for a smaller company the founder or software developers could be recruiters -->
