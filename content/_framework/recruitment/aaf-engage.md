### Engage



<!-- How does a recruiter establish contact with potential candidates? -->



How do we establish contact with them? What are the different options? How much are we prepared to invest in each outgoing communication? What are we expecting in terms of success metrics? Do we adopt a volume-based approach, or a quality based approach? Do we know who is going to be responsible for this vast body of work?

We need to make sure that the messaging is carefully scripted, trying to optimize for the following components:
* tone
* credibility
* context
* personalization
* clarity

We might come up with the following intro message:

> *Name,*

> *I’ve read all about your work @ insert_company_name doing insert_personalized_content.*

> *We are a Berlin based engineering team focused on setting the direction of Observability for the next 10-20 years. After working in Google’s Distributed Tracing team for a combined 30+ years, we realized that it’s possible and preferable to combine Metrics, Traces & Logs under one single intuitive UI. Check out our backgrounds here and here, or check out our demo here.*

> *After securing $3M in Series A funding from our preferred investors, we’re looking to scale the Backend engineering team with further energy, knowledge and enthusiasm. From what we’ve read about your background, you would be a perfect fit. Please take a look at the formal requirements here.*

> *Would you be open to jumping on a call to discuss in more detail?*

> *Best regards,*
> *Recruiter*

The messaging must be continually improved, updated, critiqued, and optimized (A/B testing, hiring manager feedback, cross-team collaboration etc). 

Eventually, we will end up with a scenario where we have interested candidates ready to interview.
