### On-board

Now that all of this work has been done, it's essential that a thorough on-boarding process is carried out to ensure that the transition passes as smoothly as possible. Some of the key questions that need to be addressed:
   - How was Week 1?
   - How was Month 1?
   - How is the relationship between new hire and manager?
   - What does the rest of the team look like?
   - Is the new hire working on things discussed beforehand?
   - How does the new hire enjoy the day-to-day working culture?
   - What changes would the new hire make if in charge?
   - What is the new hire expected to accomplish by the end of the quarter?
   - What is the new hire expected to accomplish by the end of the year?
   - Does the new hire think that this is achievable?
