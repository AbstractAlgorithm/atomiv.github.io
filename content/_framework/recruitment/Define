### Define

<!-- TODO: to define the organisational needs - EXPAND, for top management audience -->
<!-- TODO: recruitment roadmap - EXPAND, for top management audience... what's in a roadmpa, maybe some examples -->

Once the project team has been established, it is important that they get together to outline the key objectives and discuss the optimization challenges that they are facing.

Some of the key questions to address:
* What is the budget
* What are the time constraints
* What is the level of flexibility when it comes to budget and time
* How does this hire fit within the broader context of a long-term hiring roadmap
* Is the role definition understood across the team
* Where is this information going to be stored, and is their need for permissioned access
* How frequently does the team need to meet to review progress
* What does success look like

These are primarily "big picture" questions which frame the recruitment needs against the broader backdrop of organisation structure and strategy. Once those relationships have been understood, it is time to turn to the specific requirements. 

**Define the ideal profile**, in terms of the following:

* Hard skills (what the new hire will bring to the table on day 1)
     * Essential + Desired
* Soft skills (what personal characteristics will be important in being successful)
     * Essential + Desired
* Motivation (why this person want to make this change)

See the [template](https://atomiv.org/templates/recruitment/profile) for defining an ideal profile. Some of the factors that affect these definitions include: building for short term v building for long term, value driven business v outcomes driven business, desire to retain existing culture v desire to transform existing culture, immediate impact required v gradual ramping up.

<!-- Ideal vs good enough, how do you know when to stop looking (maybe in another section), indicators which one is suitable in which cases -->
     
**Define the interview process**, in terms of the following:
 * Who is going to be involved
 * How will it be structured
 * What is the rationale for each stage
 * What are the ideal outcomes for each stage
 * What are the feedback mechanisms that will guide the process

The major optimization challenge here is to build an interview process that is sufficiently rigorous that it eliminates all unsuitable candidates, without placing unnecessary procedural barriers that discourage capable applicants from completing the interview process. A seven stage process will usually generate more useful insights about candidate suitability than a three stage process, but, the length of the process itself may become an obstacle. When thinking about this dynamic, the recruitment team should aim to remove as much friction as possible, without compromising unduly on screening rigor. An interview process that is simultaneously enjoyable and challenging is a standard feature of hiring at companies who have been successful in navigating this optimization challenge.


**Define the search strategy**, in terms of the following:
  
 * Passive Strategy
    * Posting adverts and generating candidate flow via responses 
    * These adverts may be places on resources like LinkedIn, Job Boards, Industry Networking websites, and so on
    * The cost is best calculated in terms of total advertising cost, and time invested in screening incoming resumes
 * Active Strategy
    * Identifying candidates via boolean querying of web resources
    * These queries can be run against datasets contained on LinkedIn, Job Boards, GitHub, Internal Databases, and so on
    * The cost is best calculated in terms of subscription cost, and time invested in active outreach
 * Hybrid Strategy
    * Elements of both of the above

   
### Anticipate

Once the high-level and low-level definition has been finalised, it is tempting to jump straight into the project execution phase. However, and this is especially true in organisations that are lacking in maturity, or operating at a high-velocity, it is vital to build an index of resources that will be required throughout the interview process.

This comes down to the fact that recruitment is a two-way exercise. On the one hand, it is important to define and screen so that the right candidates are identified and assessed. On the other hand, candidates must be provided with a set of informational resources which will allow them to understand the nature of the organisation that they are contemplating joining. An additional reason for encouraging this phase is that it enables to recruiting team to synchronize on messaging, presentation and language.


<!-- Before starting interviews, you'll know who the company is, what they do, how they differentiate themselves, what the culture looks like.... give people resources instead of addressing it directly.... you start to look at org as outsider, where would someone find info... neeed to make sure everyone on the team (recruiters / intervewsi) knows where they are and can link to them... Mostly useful for recruiters but also a marketing exercise. Better attract talent.... Linking to optimization - knhowledge is centralized accessbile, avoiding re-explaining same topics... and also consistent messaging between recruitment and hiring and founders, everyone on panel similar language... this is like project management -->

Make a list of the resources available to candidates looking to learn more about the business. This may include:

* Website
* Collateral documents 
* Demo videos or other product explainers
* Relevant team bios
* Company blog
* Links to press, publicity or announcements
* Past employee feedback from places like Glassdoor
* Funding announcements from places like Crunchbase
* Customer testimonials or case studies
* A simple app outlining key info
* Any other online/offline resources that add value



<!-- Clarification: These are factors regarding which employees to target vs avoid, based on the companies they work in... demands and restrictions and availabilities -->

Another valuable set of materials to collate pertains to resources that will help the recruiter in any active outbound campaigns that he/she chooses to embark upon. This may include:

* Ideal target companies (e.g. competitors, companies of a similar size/stage, companies with a similar hiring bar)
* Companies to avoid (e.g. clients, partners, investor network affiliations, companies with a low hiring bar etc)
* Relevant companies that are experiencing layoffs
* Former colleagues from team network (to target referrals)
* Past messaging used in previous hiring activities
