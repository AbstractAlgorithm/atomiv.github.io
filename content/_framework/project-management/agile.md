## What is Agile? 

First of all we wanna define and say what agile is and what it represents. The term of agile is known for a long time, but it is very important to act accordingly.
Being agile means inspect and adapt. Stop and check what you are doing, and you are doing it well or there is an easier and better way to do it. 
Embrace the change, adapt to it.
 
Do something about your plan, even if that is just a small, tine part, but the progress is what matters the most, not the perfect product or service at the end. 
All of the previous sentences combined together represent agile.
So the next question would be who or what can be agile, and how is that applicable to a one company and the team?

## Scrum

All of the above sounds great and easy to apply, but in real life, when managers try to do it among the team members and one company, they realize that there must be some steps and processes which should be followed in order to ease the process and the whole transformation. 

That is why we have chosen Scrum as one of the most effective and applicable framework. 

It has been created to simplify agile process and transformation, and to help teams to deliver products or services faster and better. 

Scrum says that we should go step by step, create one thing by one, test it, make sure that it is working and that is ready to be delivered. In that way we will have at least something done and ready to be presented to the clients and stakeholders. Presenting a part of the product is a very important part of this process. Not just because the client is expecting it, this also has the motivational effect on the team which results with positive income.  

## Scrum roles 

* Product owner: 
* Scrum master:  
* Scrum team:  
* Stakeholders: 

## Scrum processes, steps and components 

Scrum as a framework has already predefined steps and processes which should be followed in order to simplify the process. But of course, that can and should be modified by the team who will apply it and use it.
Every company and team is different therefore, managers should finish their homework, research framework and adjust it to fit perfectly to the team and projects.

Still, Scrum have some basics which should be followed: 

1. Backlog: 
2. Sprint: 
3. User stories/deliverables:  
4. Scrum meetings 

## Scrum meetings 

* Sprint planning: 
* Sprint retrospective: 
* Daily standup meetings:
* Grooming:
