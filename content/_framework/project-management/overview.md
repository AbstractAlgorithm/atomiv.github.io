## Introduction to Project Management

Probably one of the most important part of successful company is good management. Almost everyone who are dealing with any type of project development must have a project manager.

Therefore, were are coming to the main question, who is a IT Project manager?

Definitely, that would be a person who is going to make sure that project is successfully fulfilled form beginning till end with defined, time, budget, and resources.

There are certain points that define every project, and those are its duration, scope, goal, budget, resources, stakeholders and of course risks. In ideal and the easiest situation the PM will run only one project, with the team who is going to work only on that project, knowing what to do and easy going clients.  
  
This is never going to happen. That is why the responsibility of one good manager is to have good communication skills, to handle all requests from the team and client and to make sure that all risks are addressed and prevent from happening, on time.

## Principles and Processes in Project Management

Of course, there are principles and processes how this can be managed properly, but all of that must be adjusted by the projects, services, or products which company provide.

Also, every good manager will find its own way how to manage projects using those processes.  The one thing which is common for all of them is documentation.  
  
Certainly one of the biggest help in project management is documentation and its existence. Usually, when team members hears the word “documentation” is the end of the world because PM is going to make them to write essays how they did they job.  
  
But this shouldn’t be the case, documentation can represent the ordinary notepad file with few simple, but important note for the requirements or past meeting, and one good PM knows and practice all the time.

## Communication in Project Management

As we said, there are many different principles how project should be managed, but we want to share with you something which is usually not covered by book but means almost everything. If somebody is managing a project that usually means that he or she is working and managing one whole team.  
Are project going to be successful or not, in a lot depends on people who are working on it. That is why we need to stop talking just about which qualifications, degree, or course certain future or current PM has, we need to talk about its possibility to understand the team and to pull out the best of it.

Communication during project or team management is the vital part of a successful project. How the project scope and requirements will be presented, explained and handled will reflect the final outcome and team satisfaction. There must be an atmosphere where the team members are comfortable to ask questions, make inquiries and mistakes as well. 
Project manager is directly responsible for the atmosphere and the communication in the projects so everything starts from him or her and reflects to the team, so try to stay open minded which will help you to realize and understand all needs, the team and stakeholders as well.
