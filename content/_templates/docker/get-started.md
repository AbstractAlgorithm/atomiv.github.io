## Installation

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to build image and run container.

## Containers

The following are settings ensuring Docker is running on Linux containers. This is useful because more images are available on Linux containers. It also happens that when using Windows containers and trying to pull that we get the error "no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries" which is solved by the steps below.

1. Right-hand click on Docker
2. If you see "Switch to Linux containers", then click on it and wait a few minutes
3. If you see "Switch to Windows containers", then click on it and wait a few minutes



<!-- FUTURE: when committing, automate the whole process
TODO: VC CHECK: initially laptop, then virtual machine on server  for long term
Demo - laptop - screencast recording (VC) -->
