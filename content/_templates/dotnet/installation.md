## Environment Setup

The following are needed to be installed to run .NET applications:

* [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) \(we have used .NET Core SDK 3.1\)
* [SQL Server 2017 Developer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Development Tools

Additionally, the following should be installed by developers:

* [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) \(we have used Visual Studio Community 2019, and installed via the Visual Studio Installer: ASP.NET and web development\)
* [SQL Server Management Studio 17.9.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017).

Note: Instead of Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code could also be used, depending on individual preferences.
