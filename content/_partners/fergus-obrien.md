Fergus provides offsite consulting for tech companies requiring external help with Recruitment Strategy, Search Execution and Executive Search. This may mean helping internal recruiters to devise and execute a recruitment strategy for a given time period, or it may mean owning a strategically important requirement from start-to-finish, or it may mean making ad-hoc contributions to a scaling effort over a longer period of time. Every company in growth mode has a continuous flow of recruitment challenges to negotiate, and Fergus is able to parachute in quickly to assist with unblocking, empowering and assisting recruitment teams. In recent years, many of those teams have been based in California, but Fergus has worked successfully with teams in most of the world's time-zones (from Santiago to Singapore).
