## Configuration Management

**Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Terraform**

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates infrastructure, platform and application management in a descriptive way.

The configuration files (written in json or yaml) are stored in version control system and are serving as single source of truth.

Idempotence - same call repeatedly produces same result, is a principle of IaC that ensures consistent state in the environment.
