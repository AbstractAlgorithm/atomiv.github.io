<h2 id="principles">Principles</h2>

<p>The core principles underlying Atomiv is that standardization and innovation are the key to building 10x Software Development teams. At Atomiv, we adopt an all-rounded approach, covering processes, architecture and quality standards.</p>

<h2 id="standards">Standards</h2>

<p>Atomiv provides standards for software processes, software architecture and software quality. The core standards and best practices behind high performance IT organizations. The foundation of success lies in the organization itself. It requires a mix of the 3P’s: People, Processes and Product.</p>

<h2 id="templates">Templates</h2>

<p>Atomiv is an open source framework for accelerated software development. Atomiv provides templates for the entire software architecture, encompassing backend, frontend and test automation. These templates enable teams to achieve accelerated software development. Currently we provide .NET Core templates for backend development, but we will also plan to include Java Spring, PHP Laravel for backend, and including Angular, React and Vue for frontend.</p>

<h2 id="technical-features-net-core-31">Technical Features (.NET Core 3.1)</h2>

<p>For .NET Core 3.1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Atomiv includes a template, which can be installed via NuGet - and after inputting the project name, a new solution will be generated for you with all the architectural layers and with sample code (customers, products and orders) which can be used a starting point and practical example for implementation</li>
  <li>Atomiv provides standardized implementation for CRUD operations across all layers of the sofware (from REST controllers, to application services, to repositories)</li>
  <li>Atomiv has pre-packaged popular NuGet packages, including Entity Framework Core 2, FluentAssertions, AutoMapper, MediatR, which are used for implementation in the infrastructure layer - however, these are defaults, so you are not locked in but can choose other packages and provides, because Atomiv relies on interfaces so that third party libraries and frameworks are easily swappable</li>
  <li>Atomiv is designed to be high performance, especially efficient operations with  Entity Framework Core 2 - efficiently working with large data sets</li>
  <li>Atomiv contains components which simplify automated testing, especially Selenium and REST API testing, so that automated tests can be produced faster and with less code</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="team-features">Team Features</h2>

<p>Atomiv provides templates for all team members:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Project managers</li>
  <li>Backend developers</li>
